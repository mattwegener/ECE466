Your project report should include:
1. Problem description and solution outline.
2. SW-HW handshaking protocol timing diagram, with discussion.
3. State diagram of the handshaking protocol for HW, with discussion.
4. Flow chart of the handshaking protocol for SW, with discussion.
5. Block diagram of the HW multiplier datapath, with discussion.
6. State diagram of the HW multiplier controller, with discussion.
7. SystemC code snippet(s) of the HW multiplier, with discussion.
8. SystemC code snippet(s) of the SW function communicating with HW multiplier, with discussion.
9. Recommendations.


The project mark is distributed as follows:
25% - correct output,
50% - correct SystemC implementation,
25% - project report.


If you complete the bonus part, your report must also include:
10. Block diagram of the HW divider datapath, with discussion.
11. State diagram of the HW divider controller, with discussion.
12. Recommendations.
